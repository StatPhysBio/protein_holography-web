Important Note: High confidence in 1JM7 as it is mentioned by the paper. The PDB structure is different from the alpha fold structure, because the alpha fold is the entire protein, and the pdb is a domain.

-1JM7: Entity 1, Solution structure of the BRCA1/BARD1 RING-domain heterodimer
Method: SOLUTION NMR
Seq Length: 112
Alignment Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 1.458e-69, Region: 1-110
DMS Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 3.634e-63, Region: 1-101
Two extra amino acids on the end relative to alignment sequence, I don't know about precision of this method.
