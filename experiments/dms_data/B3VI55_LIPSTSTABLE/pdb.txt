Important Note: The colabfold generated structure is high accuracy, but may not have the structural characteristics that this stable variant has. PDB ids AND alphafold unsatisfactory, because this DMS file is the study of a LGK mutant created in this study "LGK.1 (L140I, S142A, A373C)" to be more temperature stable. Thus, its sequence differs slightly (by 3 amino acid swaps) to all the LGK models' sequences.

"Analysis of the native crystal structure of LGK", LGK is levoglucosan kinase, paper links to http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M115.674614. THe protein was studied with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of it as a catalyst. The study creates specifically thermostable versions of the protein, the best of which is LGK.3, with a PDB id of 4ZXZ. I would not classify those structures as the protein used in the DMS experiments, because the DMS study references a different study where the crystal structure of native LGK was analyzed, and that study performs crystallization of LGK in "magnesium crystallization buffer", and other buffers for the other complexes, but nothing with just the LGK. The PDB ids referenced by the DMS study are the same as those in the structure study.
