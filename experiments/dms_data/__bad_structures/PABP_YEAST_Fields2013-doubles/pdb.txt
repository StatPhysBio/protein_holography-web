Important Note: Used the alignment sequence to generate colabfold structure because the DMS sequence has gaps. The paper uses a modified protein with only 3 out of 4 domains which makes the protein significantly more reactive to amino acid swaps. No satisfactory PDB.

This paper is about RNA recognition motifs, specifically the "poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1)" of yeast. 577 amino acids initally, but they remove large sections of the protein in DMS testing. "Based on these observations, we chose the Pab1(1–343) fragment as the scaffold into which mutations would be introduced."
