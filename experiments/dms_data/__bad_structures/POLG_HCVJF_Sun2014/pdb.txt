Qi, H. et al. A quantitative high-resolution genetic profile rapidly identifies sequence determinants of hepatitis C viral fitness and drug sensitivity. PLoS Pathog. 10, e1004064 (2014). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004064
This paper is about the domain IA of the NS5A protein for Hepatitis C, which they mutated and studied the impact on replication fitness and Daclatasvir (HCV drug) resistance.
