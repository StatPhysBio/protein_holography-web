Important Note: The colabfold generated structure is only for the Zn2Cys6-class domain, used the alignment sequence to generate. The correct wild type strain (BY4741) does not match the strain of the alpha fold structure. The pdb structure is not satisfactory.

The paper references the PDB 3COQ, the reason why a binding with DNA may be the correct structure is " Gal4 binds DNA as a homodimer via a Zn2Cys6-class domain centered on a pair of Zn2+ ions, which help to maintain the fold of the DNA-binding residues"

-3COQ: Entity 3, Structural Basis for Dimerization in DNA Recognition by Gal4
Method: X-RAY DIFFRACTION 2.4 Å
Seq Length: 89
Alignment Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 1.106e-39, Region: 1-68
DMS Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 6.604e-33, Region: 1-58
missing starting amino acids, and extra ending amino acids, appears to be a complex with DNA

Method: SOLUTION NMR
Seq Length: 43
Alignment Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 3.65e-23, Region: 1-43
DMS Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 1.424e-22, Region: 2-43
Shorter than both DMS and Alignment seq

-1D66: Entity 3, DNA RECOGNITION BY GAL4: STRUCTURE OF A PROTEIN/DNA COMPLEX
Method: X-RAY DIFFRACTION 2.40 Å
Seq Length: 66
Alignment Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 3.306e-37, Region: 1-65
DMS Sequence Identity: 100%, E-Value: 3.288e-36, Region: 2-65
Extra starting amino acid relative to DMS, less ending, is a complex with DNA
