Important Note: The alpha fold structure and the pdb structure differ because the alpha fold is the entire protein, and the pdb is only the domain.

The paper references the pdb 1BE9, which may be the proper representation because what the paper is measuring is the ability for the protein to bond to a ligand, and it is sequenced after bonding.
