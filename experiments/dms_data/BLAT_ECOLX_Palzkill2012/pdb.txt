Important Note: The alpha fold structure is correct. The pdb structure is more complicated, because it matches the DMS sequence, but the DMS sequence starts at the 24th residue position, although it seems to me that that is a protein domain. However, the paper states the enzyme in question is the same length as the pdb sequence.

High confidence that 1XPB is the right structure, as TEM-1 enzyme is said to have 263 amino acid positions in the paper
